Jobio's mission is to help matching job seekers with jobs that are suitable for them.

Have you ever read a 2-page long job ad only to find it requires you to be in the office that you can't get to 5 days a week? Have you gone through another 2-page long job ad only to find it wants a junior with 5 years of proven experience that you do not have?

We are here to help saving your time going through countless number of pages of job ads, only to find out at the end: it's not a job that you would apply for.

## What do we need to know to help you?

1. Upload your CV as a file. We currently accept `.pdf`, `.docx`, and `.txt` files.
2. Input your "deal breakers" for a job. The currently limit is 5 deal breakers.
3. Paste the job ad on the Matching page.

## How do we match you up with the job ad? A.k.a. what will be on the Matching page?

1. An overall matching score
2. Point out any deal breakers the job ad includes
3. A small matching summary
4. List of matched and missing skills
5. Short conclusion message at the end suggesting if you should apply for it of not
